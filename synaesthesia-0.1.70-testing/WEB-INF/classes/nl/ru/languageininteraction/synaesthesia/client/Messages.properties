introductionscreentext=It strongly advised that the Butcher should be Conveyed in a separate ship: But the Bellman declared that would never agree With the plans he had made for the trip: Navigation was always a difficult art, Though with only one ship and one bell: And he feared he must really decline, for his part, Undertaking another as well. The Beaver\u2019s best course was, no doubt, to procure A second-hand dagger-proof coat-- So the Baker advised it--and next, to insure Its life in some Office of note: This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire (On moderate terms), or for sale, Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire, And one Against Damage From Hail. Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day, Whenever the Butcher was by, The Beaver kept looking the opposite way, And appeared unaccountably shy.

userfeedbackscreentext=The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow. \u201cIf only you\u2019d spoken before! It\u2019s excessively awkward to mention it now, With the Snark, so to speak, at the door! \u201cWe should all of us grieve, as you well may believe, If you never were met with again-- But surely, my man, when the voyage began, You might have suggested it then? \u201cIt\u2019s excessively awkward to mention it now-- As I think I\u2019ve already remarked.\u201d And the man they called \u201cHi!\u201d replied, with a sigh, \u201cI informed you the day we embarked. \u201cYou may charge me with murder--or want of sense-- (We are all of us weak at times): But the slightest approach to a false pretence Was never among my crimes! \u201cI said it in Hebrew--I said it in Dutch-- I said it in German and Greek: But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much) That English is what you speak!\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis a pitiful tale,\u201d said the Bellman, whose face Had grown longer at every word: \u201cBut, now that you\u2019ve stated the whole of your case, More debate would be simply absurd. \u201cThe rest of my speech\u201d (he explained to his men) \u201cYou shall hear when I\u2019ve leisure to speak it. But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again! \u2019Tis your glorious duty to seek it! \u201cTo seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care; To pursue it with forks and hope; To threaten its life with a railway-share; To charm it with smiles and soap! \u201cFor the Snark\u2019s a peculiar creature, that won\u2019t Be caught in a commonplace way. Do all that you know, and try all that you don\u2019t: Not a chance must be wasted to-day! \u201cFor England expects--I forbear to proceed: \u2019Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite: And you\u2019d best be unpacking the things that you need To rig yourselves out for the fight.\u201d Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed), And changed his loose silver for notes. The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair, And shook the dust out of his coats. The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade-- Each working the grindstone in turn: But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed No interest in the concern: Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride, And vainly proceeded to cite A number of cases, in which making laces Had been proved an infringement of right. The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned A novel arrangement of bows: While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand Was chalking the tip of his nose. But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine, With yellow kid gloves and a ruff-- Said he felt it exactly like going to dine, Which the Bellman declared was all \u201cstuff.\u201d \u201cIntroduce me, now there\u2019s a good fellow,\u201d he said, \u201cIf we happen to meet it together!\u201d And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head, Said \u201cThat must depend on the weather.\u201d The Beaver went simply galumphing about, At seeing the Butcher so shy: And even the Baker, though stupid and stout, Made an effort to wink with one eye. \u201cBe a man!\u201d said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard The Butcher beginning to sob. \u201cShould we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird, We shall need all our strength for the job!\u201d
